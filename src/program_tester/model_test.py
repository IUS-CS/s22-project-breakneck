This file test our model accuracy

we don't have our model yet, so I'm unable to build this test system right now.

Our idea is to use a pretrained VGG16 model (maybe modify it a little) to 
predict the output of our image generation model to see how close the result
will be.

We have to consturct our image generation model first so we know what's our 
output size going to be, then we can start build our test system.

So, this file remain empty temporally righg now.
