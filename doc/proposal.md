 Project Proposal
 
 - The current goal of Breakneck is to create a [Windows/Console] application that uses deep-learning AI to create an image based on images feed into it.
 - The three main functions that need to be tested is the input of the image, the training of the AI, and the output of an image.
 - The programming language that will be used is Python using the Anaconda IDE.
 - Several image datasets like Keras will be used to train the AI.
